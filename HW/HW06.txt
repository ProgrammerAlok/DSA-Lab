Take a list as input and search an element from the list whether it is there or not. If it is there then display the location also.Take a list as input and then sort half of the list in ascending order and other half in descending order.Take a number and extract its digits and store them in an array. Now take two variables, one will hold the sum of odd positions digits and other will sum the rest. The positions will consider from the left. If odd sum is greater than the even, then the number is called magic number. And if both are square number, then it is called super magic.
EX=> 123456  sum1=1+3+5                           sum2=2+4+6
Take a name as input, sort the characters in ascending order. Take a number from the user, if all the digits from the right hand side are in ascending order, the number is called “Big-Head”, the reverse is called “Big-Tail”, otherwise it is called a “simple” number. Decide the type of the number.
